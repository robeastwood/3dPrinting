# Cura Settings & Profile

Cura 4.7.1 seemed to string more than 4.6.2 so I've stuck with 4.6.x for now.

Printer settings are based on the Creality CR10, as the CR6 is not available yet as an option in cura.

Profiles:

    - Fine: 0.12 layer height. Slow to print but high quality.
    - Standard: 0.2 layer height. Takes about 1/2 the time of the fine profile. Still good, better at bridging.
    - Antistring: Based on standard, but with additional X-Hop. I found this works better for low quality filaments that are more prone to stringing issues. It can't remove all wispy hairs though.
